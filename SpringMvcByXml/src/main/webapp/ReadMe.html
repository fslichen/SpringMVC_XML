	<h1>Spring MVC and Spring</h1>
	<p>
		Spring MVC and spring are independent, which means that you are allowed to use spring MVC 
		without using spring. As a matter of fact, I've deleted all the spring configurations. There can 
		be no listener for spring, there can be no applicationContext.xml		
	</p>
	<h1>Spring MVC Maven</h1>
	<p>
		In maven defintions, you can delete all the spring related maven dependencies, 
		such as the spring-core, spring-context, or spirng-web. And spring-webmvc is all you need.
	</p>
	<h1>web.xml Configurations</h1>
	<p>
		In web.xml, all you need is just a servlet definition, like what you did in the basic servlet
		definition, you can do the same thing for spring-mvc.
	</p>
	<h1>spring-mvc.xml Configurations</h1>
	<p>
		The configurations for spring-mvc.xml is much like applicationContext.xml.
		You can define spring beans inside, and use component-scan. Please don't forget to put 
		component-scan in your configuration file, otherwise spring-mvc is not going to detect the 
		@RestController annotation inside the controller, therefore you will encounter lots of 404s.
		And MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter can transfer a json string into a POJO 
		by using @RequestBody inside the controller.
